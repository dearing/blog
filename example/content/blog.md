I'm still figuring out how all this will ultimatly fit together.  I have Redis and OAuth2 working well enough but what I need to plan out is the administation console
Presently, I'm doing things the old school way, Posting form data to and from the server.  Websockets would be a good way to go then I could just design the whole page
to look like a kind of backend console.

funcionality
----
- create new posts
- edit posts
- delete posts
- rename posts
- redis-cli psuedo-console access (websocket piped around etc)
- log views and metrics
- google chat api to view that shit
